# Welcome to Safety Radius

## Project goal 

Provides a visualization tool for users to examine the safety of San Francisco using a safety circle and a web map. Users start 
by picking a point in the map, which will serve as center for the safety circle. A colored safety circle will be plotted, informing if the region is dangerous, a place to be careful or safe.
