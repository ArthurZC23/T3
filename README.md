# Welcome to Safety Radius

## Project goal 

Provides a visualization tool for users to examine the safety of San Francisco using a safety circle and a web map. Users start 
by picking a point in the map, which will serve as center for the safety circle. A colored safety circle will be plotted, informing if the region is dangerous, a place to be careful or safe. The information is encoded in the filling color of the circle and in the audio message played when the safety radius is displayed at the map. The user can adjust the radius of the circle, using the linear slider below the map. There are five available options.

## User profile

People that want a tool to help them walk safe in San Francisco. The user can be color blind, as there is also sound data to inform the level of danger of the region.

## Plataform

The proof of concept was made in using a webapp. It was not designed for mobile use, although it can be opened in a mobile browser.
